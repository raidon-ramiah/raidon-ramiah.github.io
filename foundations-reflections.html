      <h2>Final Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        <li class="question">
          What are three new things I've learnt about myself and my ego during
          the core learning?
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          1. The first thing I learnt was the importance of reflection.
          Reflection allowed me to learn from my experiences, even if there were
          no egregious mistakes. This really made me more thoughtful and
          deliberate in my problem solving and learning.
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          2. I found the neuroplasticity part of core very intriguing. I've
          begun learning with an underlying belief that I am remoulding my brain
          every time I practice effectively.
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          3. I learnt that sometimes its okay to ask for help. I always find
          that the frustration from a simple mistake is a good learning point to
          ensure that it never happens sgain, however sometimes I was so stuck
          that I needed to ask for help, and that was okay. Programming is hard.
          The assistance is there for me if I ask, and often I learn so much
          more when I do, so for me learning when to ask for help was impactful.
        </li>
        <li class="question">
          What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning
          and programing?
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          Your values are everything, they shape who you are, how you act, and
          why you act as such. Our entire learning journey, which ideally
          includes our future as developers, is therefore just a consequence of
          underlying values and goals. Empathy and self awareness are key to
          working within a team, or working with people that come from different
          backgrounds. Everyone has different values, goals, and backgrounds.
          Being aware of that, and being self aware to know how you fit in to
          this medley is half the puzzle. The other half is empathy. Empathy is
          actually acknowledging everyone around you and being caring.

        <li class="question">
          What has surprised you the most about core learning?
        </li>
        <li class="question">
          Why do you think we are spending so much time focusing on core
          learning?
        </li>
        <li class="question">
          Do you think the time you spent studying core learning felt like a
          waste of time?
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          Honestly, I initially thought core learning going to be about learning
          platitudes, and that core learning would be less of a focus. I was
          completely wrong, core learning teaches very important lessons and
          skills that are incredibly important as a learner. I think Dev Academy
          has a focus on core because of all the beenfits of core learning, and
          its applicability and importance in the real world. In reality, people
          will only want to work with someone who they want to work with. What I
          mean by this is that someone who is reflective, communicative,
          empathetic, and self aware is a superior programmer and colleague.
          That is why I do not think the time I spent learning core was a waste
          of time.
        </li>
        <li class="question">
          What are the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          The most difficult aspects were probably when I had to reflect on
          myself and my background. I usually tend to think about the future
          rather than the past, so it was a bit of change to reflect on
          everything, but I am glad I did because it is so incrdibly useful.
