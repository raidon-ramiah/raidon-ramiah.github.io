      <h2>The time...</h2>

      <li class="question">I was stuck on a simple problem</li>
      <li class="answer">
        I couldn't count backwards from the highest number to the lowest number.
        Despite it being seemingly a simple challenge, I couldn't seem to solve
        it. I double and triple-checked my logic, but I could not work out what
        the issue was. I asked for help in the tech-questions channel after
        this. I got help, firstly through understanding arrays and indexes
        better, then also understanding what array.length does. After learning
        more about arrays and indexes, I was able to solve my problem.
      </li>

      <li class="question">that I elegantly solved a problem</li>
      <li class="answer">
        After learning more about forEach loops and object methods I was able to
        do some cool things on the katas. I learnt about them after being stuck
        on previous problems involving them. When I had to do a new kata I was
        able to use my prior knowledge to complete most of it, and used a bit of
        google and MDN Web Docs to fill in the details. I was able to solve the
        rest of the katas fairly easily using more efficient, more
        straightforward methods. It felt great doing this, and I learnt that
        sometimes a setback can lead to greater success if you learn from it.
      </li>
      <li class="question">that I was reluctant to ask for help</li>
      <li class="answer">
        During the Javascript Cafe exercise I wasn't to keen to ask for help
        bevcause I was doing the stretch exercises which are meant to be a
        challenge. I spent ages stuck on a bunch of them and my stubbornness
        ended up hindering my progress. The next week, if I was stuck I just
        asked for help and it kept me moving forward productively.
      </li>
      <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
      <li class="question">Pseudocode</li>
      <li class="answer">
        I'm confident using Pseudocode and use it to approach most difficult
        problems
      </li>
      <li class="question">Trying Something</li>
      <li class="answer">
        Always happy to try something even if I dont know the outcome, usually
        it points me in the right direction.
      </li>
      <li class="question">Rubber Ducky Method</li>
      <li class="answer">
        I dont really use the rubber ducky method because my Pseudocode
        explaining the code to myself is done at a rubber ducky level
        explanation. Although in the future I might start explaining my code to
        my dog.
      </li>
      <li class="question">Reading Error Messages</li>
      <li class="answer">
        I'm confident in reading error messages to find which line is causing an
        error, however I could defnintely learn a lot more about what different
        errors are and what they mean.
      </li>
      <li class="question">Console.log</li>
      <li class="answer">Always use it, its such a valuable tool.</li>
      <li class="question">Googling</li>
      <li class="answer">
        Google is the One Piece. I'm cpnfident in my googling abilities as I use
        it for everything.
      </li>
      <li class="question">Asking Peers for Help</li>
      <li class="answer">
        I'm more than happy to ask my peers for help, although during
        Foundations it can be difficult because everyone is doing the same thing
        but at different times.
      </li>
      <li class="question">Asking Coaches for Help</li>
      <li class="answer">
        I'm confident in asking for help when I need it. Ive gotten a whole new
        level of understanding every time I've asked for help and will continue
        to do so in the future.
      </li>
      <li class="question">Improving My Process with Reflection</li>
      <li class="answer">
        I am still working on thi skill. I have used it a couple times and its
        helped me out, like when I specificallt was more careful and delibarate
        with my syntax. I think improving with reflectin is definitely something
        I could apply way way more though! It is too useful to neglect.
