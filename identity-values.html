      <h2>About Me // The Who</h2>
      <p>
        When deciding to join Dev Academy, I had a number of things of things on
        my mind. I had to make a decision for my future versus my present. The
        idea of doing this course had to be weighed against the time value of
        just working an entry-level job. Now that I'm studying here, I'm glad I
        made the right choice.
      </p>

        My culture is one that is all about acceptance, learning, and
        connections. These are just a few things from a long list of things I've
        learnt from my family and those around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strengths are my logical and creative thinking. I think that I have a
        strong sense of both logic and out-of-the-box thinking that allows me to
        approach challenges from differing angles and ultimately learn from
        these experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, my thinking style can also be a weakness as I sometimes
        forget to do the simple things. My career devleopment in this industry
        is non-existent and I just hope to achieve as much as I can so that I
        may be able to change that.

        When working on a group film project in high school, someone else and I
        had different ideas about how it should be made. My friend wanted to
        make this a comedy and I wanted to make a horror. Keep in mind that the
        two are surprisingly similar (as shown
        <a

        >). Ultimately, we couldn't compromise or it would have been the worst
        of both worlds. I decided to go with my friends idea because I did
        bleieve in it, and put my all into making it as good as possinle. The
        result was a project I was really happy with, despite it not being what
        I had originally envisioned. At the end of the day, communication is
        always the most important thing in a group dynamic.
