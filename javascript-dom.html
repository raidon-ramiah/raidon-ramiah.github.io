      <h2>Get Jacked Javascript: Juggernaut Edition</h2>
      <p>
        <li class="question">
          What is Javascript? How is related to HTML and CSS?
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          Javascript is an incredibly powerful programming language that is
          considered the language of the web. If HTML makes up a body, and CSS
          makes up its appearance, Javascipt is the brains of the operation. It
          is the difference between a mannequin and a person. It transforms
          documents that could've been printed out, into a dynamic, responsive,
          and functional webpage. Instead of just showing you dressed up static
          content, Javascript has the inquisitiveness to ask questions and come
          up with answers.
        </li>
      </p>
      <li class="question">What can you do with Javascript?</li>
      <li class="answer">
        Javascipt can answer any question, provided that it can be broken down
        into functions, loops, arrays, conditionals and objects. <b>
          <p>
            <li class="special-question">
              If you could
              ask Javascipt anything...
            </li>
          </p>
        </b>
      </li>

        <li class="question">
          How do I get jacked Javascript? // Conditionals
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          A conditional is a series of actions that may or may not be taken
          depending on a predetermined condition being met. <p>
            For example, if
            you're out of protein powder go buy some more, and if you can't find
            any at that store, try another.
          </p>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li class="question">How do I get jacked Javascript? // Functions</li>
        <li class="answer">
          A function can be anything really. I first heard of functions in
          maths, and while it is a different idea, some key points do transfer
          over. For example if you have the number 23 you could perform any
          functions upon that number to get a desired outcome (eg. sin(23), 3 -
          23, 23 * i). 
          <li  class="answer">
            A function could be more complex <li>
              (limit as x approaches
              positive and negative infinity of e^23/pi^x/x^e^13000)/
            </li>
          </li> 
          <li  class="answer">
            or less complex
            <li>(23 == 23)</li>. <p class="answer">
              The idea remains the same though, a function is a set of
              instructions that perform a task.
            </p>
          </li> 
          <p  class="answer">
            For the Get Jacked program, the
            above conditonal about protein powder could be used as a part of the eatProtein() function.
          </p>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li class="question">How do I get jacked Javascript? // Loops and Control Flows</li>
        <li class="answer">
          Loops are literally loops. You can think of a loop as a little circuit
          that will go around and around until certain conditions have been met. Loops are something that can change the control flow of a script. The control flow is the order in which script is executed. By default it will go from top to bottom, line by line, but when a loop is introduced, it will keep looping until certain conditions are met. Control flows become more complex in complex programs where everything is dependant on something else happening. 
          There are different types of loops in javascript. A for loop can be
          cycled FOR every something. <p>
            A good for loop for the Get Jacked program
            would be something like <li>
              for (0 reps, failure, rep++)<li>
                 {if you can do
                more pull ups do them, else reps == failure}.
              </li>
            </li><p  class="answer">
              The start of the loop is
              at 0, and it ends when you reach failure, every run through you add
              one rep. This would be a pretty useful function so we're going to use
              it as a part of the exercise() function.
            </p>
          </p>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li class="question">How do I get jacked Javascript? // Arrays</li>
        <li class="answer">
          An array is a bunch of elements that could be anything, stored and
          indexed into a neat list. The elements could be anything from numbers
          or strings to even variables, and they can all be stored within the
          same array. An array consisting of [Pineapple, Jaguar, 23, x,
          EIGHTEEN] would start counting its elements at 0. So 0 would be
          pineapple, and 3 would be x. Confusing and unintuitive, right? The
          good thing about arrays is how easy it is to find, manipulate,
          transform, and apply them. We could store how many pull ups we do into
          the pull ups array using something like array.push(). This way we
          would know how many pull ups we're doing each and every day. <li >
            pullups =
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,1].
          </li> <p  class="answer">
            This is useful to keep track of and we can
            use it in a variety of functions, objects and loops.
          </p>
        </li>
      </p>
      <li class="question">How do I get jacked Javascript? // Objects</li>
      <li class="answer">
        An object is similar to an array in the way that it can store lots of
        seperate pieces of information, but an object is a more general and can
        store more complex information. An object consists of key: value pairs.
        For example, an object called workout-stats={

          <li>pullups: 1</li>
          <li>pushups: 10</li>
          <li>pronehold: 1 minute 30 seconds</li>
          <li>ego: tistical</li>
          <li>hotel: trivago }</li>
        <p  class="answer">This object can be updated, changed and used in a variety of ways. You could even us an array in an object! Javascript is considered an object oriented language.</p>

      </li>
      <p>
        <li class="question">What is the DOM</li>
        <li class="answer">
          DOM is an acronymn for Document Object Model. A webpage can be thought
          of as the document. The DOM is considered an object-oriented
          representation of the web page. This means that every property,
          method, and event on a page are organised into objects that can then
          be accessed and manipulated. The DOM has HTML, CSS, and Javascipt all
          showing up together, allowing you to manipulate each one. The DOM linking together Javascript with HTML and CSS is why it so useful.<p> Whenever Javascipt affects the DOM, like by using innerHTML to change the content of HTML, the DOM shows the updated page, which is different to the original HTML document</p>
