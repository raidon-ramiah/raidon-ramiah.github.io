      <h2>The Brain's Map</h2>

      <p>
        Learning can physically change your brain. Neural connections can become
        stronger the more you learn. A neural connection is a literally a
        connection between neurons or groups of neurons. The brain is
        continuously reinforcing connection circuits to make them more efficient
        and accesible, while lesser used circuits are pruned off. Brains are
        built over time, its not like Einstein was born knowing physics. So what
        does this mean for learning? It means that, the more you practice and
        learn about something, over time your brain will adapt to this. It will
        create more neuron connections, and become more efficient at firing
        chains of these processes. The connections physically become stronger
        and denser over time. Effective learning allows you to change your
        brain. Understanding this actually sets you up to be a more capable and
        willing learner. When people know that their brains are actually dynamic
        systems that change over time they can adopt a growth mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is a mindset where everything becomes an opportunity to
        grow and learn. When setbacks occur, people with a fixed mindset would
        typically think that they are not capable of overcoming it, and that it
        is beyond their capabilities. The same setback can happen to someone
        with a growth mindset, the difference is that someone with a growth
        mindset recognises that challenges also present an opportunity to learn.
        Challanges can (not always) pull weaknesses and insufficiencies to the
        forefront of everything. The beauty of a growth mindset is that when you
        are confronted with challenges, whether they are everyday problems or
        major ones, is that it allows you to improve yourself so that you can
        manage more things over time. Whether it is a weakness of yours, or
        achieving a deeper understanding of something you already know, a growth
        mindset is one that understands that our brains our dynamic and are
        always changing. A fixed mindset simply accepts its inabilities as
        permanent traits that cannot be changed. Which, if you think that, they
        will not.
